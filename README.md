# Try 2 v0.1 no_grav

Try 2 is a game based on the arcade game "Final Fight", is a 2.5D Scrolling Fighter fully programmed in python thanks to pygame. This was built under a week so please feel free to give me feedback at ysaco7@gmail.com

For now im still trying to figure out how to do 2.5 perspective (Games like League of Legends have a good representation) but the hitbox work as it should.

## Next steps:

Improving level design, enemy spawns, doing my own splash art, adding a small window menu so you can figure out controls of the game. Adding an introductory cutscene, quality of life changes such as volume and brightness.

Building a difficulty as time goes on and spawning items with the defeat of each enemies. 

Adding a score and creating a reward system for the player.

Adding customization to the character
